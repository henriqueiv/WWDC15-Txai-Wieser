# WWDC15-Txai-Wieser - My application for the WWDC 2015 Scholarship!

## **DESCRIPTION**
This App was made to show my skills, my interests, and try to explain a little about who I am.
You'll find extra contents for each screen in AppleTV! 
All personal data is saved and retrieved using CoreData.
It was written completely in Swift and the inteface was created using a mixture of Storyboard and code.
On the main screen you find a collection of various aspects of my life!
You are free to explore them.
